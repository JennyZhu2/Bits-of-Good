                Hello, I'm Jenny, a second year CS student in the intel/info threads. 
                In highschool, I was a part of my robotics teams outreach programs and helped organize 
                STEM workshops and programs for the girl scouts and nearby school districts. 
                I also volunteered at my local library, helped out at community events and taught students python at a coding center.
                My hobbies include drawing, painting, crocheting--basically any craft that incorporates design. 
                My passion for both the creative and technical sides is why I want to join the Developer Bootcamp.
                I am excited to learn how to create a website from scratch and help others with my skills this semester!
